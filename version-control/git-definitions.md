# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tracking system for changes and updates to code.  This allows multiple users to work on code and to revert back towards a previously saved point if something should go wrong.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a divergence from a common commit point from which code can be changed and added upon independent of the main master branch.  Branches allow people to make and test segments of code before adding them into the master code branch.

You would use a branch so that multiple people could work together as a team on different parts of code.  As each part was completed, they could be merged together for the end product.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in a branch.  All of the changes that had not been previously commited will be saved following a successful commit command.

A good commit message will explain the changes that were made and will allow for memebers of your team who are debugging your code in the future to follow your logic quickly and easily.  

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when the two branches that you are attempting to merge do not have commits that are in the other branch.
