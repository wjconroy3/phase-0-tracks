<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
It creates new tags that allow for easier reading by the developer.  Instead of just using multiple <div> tags, there are tags that are fuctionally similar to <div> but instead provide context for the developer to follow.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
From top of the code to the bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned about snippets and how to make them.  Addtionally, my guide showed me the CTRL + SHIFT + D shortcut to create a copy of a line of text below the one that is active.  This is a great timesaver!

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I hadn't used a lot of these prior to this exercise, so trying to mentally conceptualize how to use them.
